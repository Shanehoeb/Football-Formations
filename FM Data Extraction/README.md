FM Data Extraction : Extracting player trajectories and event data from 2D FM Gameplay


Plan Outline : 

1. Retrieve video clips of football manager gameplay
2. Use object detection algorithms to identify player positions and ball positions
3. Use tracking algorithms to assign data to a player ID
4. Using ball and player positions to generate event data : code at https://github.com/vi3itor/soccer-event-recognition, paper at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292995807_Recognizing_Compound_Events_in_Spatio-Temporal_Football_Data
5. Format data in same style as metrica
6. Use EPV/Pitch Control models on FM data to evaluate collective team movement
